@brief  helper script to associate USB port for known hardware based on USB serial number
        * compatible with windows and linux
        * allow serial devices to be plugged in, in any order or used on other fixtures without
        having to check which port it is assigned to
        
@usage  simply run this script to determine your hardware info

note: in some cases a HW set may report the same serial numbers, in this case you should use 
ID_PATH and udev rules instead (only possible in linux), this script cant do that for you
